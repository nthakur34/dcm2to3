Between dcm4che2 and dcm4che3 there are some key differences.
To supplement in-code documentation, this file explains in detail what changed
and why.

Major Function Differences:

    1) Removed the "get" function which was used very frequently. Replaced 
    with either "getValue", "getSequence", or "newSequence" depending on the 
    circumstance. In general, getValue was used to replace almost every "get"
    in the import folder. It was used to get a sequence of items for the most
    part. "newSequence" was used in locations where a pre-existing sequence 
    didn't exist, and "getValue" or "getSequence" would fail.

Per-file Differences:

scanfile_mldcm - Creates Attributes object rather than Dicom Object
