Between dcm4che2 and dcm4che3 there are some key differences.
To supplement in-code documentation, this file explains in detail what changed
and why.

Major Function Differences:

    1) Removed the "get" function which was used very frequently. Replaced 
    with either "getValue", "getSequence", or "newSequence" depending on the 
    circumstance. In general, getValue was used to replace almost every "get"
    in the import folder. It was used to get a sequence of items for the most
    part. "newSequence" was used in locations where a pre-existing sequence 
    didn't exist, and "getValue" or "getSequence" would fail.
    In Export "get" was often replaced with setString to return a single
    element.

    get() ---> getValue()
    get() ---> getSequence()
    get() ---> newSequence()
    get() ---> setString()

    2) Removal of Dicom Objects and Dicom Elements. Both were for the most
    part, replaced by Attributes Objects. However, for Sequence Dicom Elements,
    Sequences were used (dcm4che core data class). These Sequences used
    the size function rather than countItems function, and get function
    rather than getDicomObject. No size of zero, only null, so check exists
    to turn null result into zero.

    countItems() ---> size()
    getDicomObject(i) ---> get(i)
    getDicomObject() ---> getParent()

    3) putNull replaced with setNull. If a new sequence was to be made, there
    was no need to use setNull, so it was avoided.

    putNull ---> setNull

    4) copyTo replaced with addAll

    copyTo ---> addAll

    5) subSet was replaces with self made filter function in dcmdir_add

    subSet() ---> filter()
    
    6) PersonName class was also changed greatly. Objects like "FamilyName"
    no longer correlate to array positions but rather to an Enum. So a
    workaround was used to access the variables in the Java Enum. This class
    was used in a few export functions but is primarily used in getTagValue 
    and data2dcmElement.
    

    

Important per-file Differences:

dcm2ml_Element - REPLACED by getTagValue
dcm2ml_Object - REPLACED by getTagStruct
ml2dcm_Element - REPLACED by data2dcmElement

scanfile_mldcm - Creates Attributes object rather than Dicom Object

dcmdir_add - Created a filter nested function to replace subset. Is slightly slower
             however. implemented getTagValue.

createEmptyFields - Changed manner of setting Null elements. Used Sequence.

Functions in Import Folder - Used getTagValue. Replaced the SequenceDicomElements
                             attained by using get, to Sequences.

Modules in Export - Replaced "get" uses with setString to generate single element.
                    Also replaced ml2dcm_Element
Sequences in Export - Replaced ml2dcm_Element, and generated new sequences rather
                      than using "get", and "putNull"



ISSUES

1) Date issue still persists. Can't check if date function is done correctly. 
Correct String value is stored, but unsure about date value. (In data2dcmElement)

2) Remove issue still persists in export_sequence. 

3) Center and width in viewer always seem to start at center:0 width:300
Otherwise values are correct, but i am unsure how to remedy this.
